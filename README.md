# iMac G3 PC Mod Parts

This is a repo containing STL files for 3D printing components required to modify an iMac G3 with tray loading drive. This is opposed to the slot-load drive iMac introduced later in the G3 generation. This repo is inspired by https://github.com/Diepzeevogel/iMac-G3-replacement-parts for uploading the parts he used for his project.

I'm not yet done with the mod so these may change and I will try to update them as I make updates.
