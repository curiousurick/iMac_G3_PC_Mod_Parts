# iMac G3 PC Mod Parts

This is a repo containing STL files for 3D printing components required to modify an iMac G3 with tray loading drive. This is opposed to the slot-load drive iMac introduced later in the G3 generation. This repo is inspired by https://github.com/Diepzeevogel/iMac-G3-replacement-parts for uploading the parts he used for his project.

I'm not yet done with the mod so these may change and I will try to update them as I make updates.


Additional parts taken from other repos

200mm fan mounts. I modified the piece that screws into the shell by reducing the distance to 11mm. You can find the adjusted one in this repo. The fan mount pieces work perfectly.

MicroATX Motherboard Mount that I glued to the ramps in this repo.
Note, you can get a miniItx mount from Diepzeevogel's repo if you wish and you can tweak the ramp to 170mm in length or just print as-is and leave extra space on the ramp.
